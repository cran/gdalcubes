\title{Create an image collection from a STAC feature collection}
\usage{
stac_image_collection(
  s,
  out_file = tempfile(fileext = ".sqlite"),
  asset_names = NULL,
  asset_regex = NULL,
  url_fun = .default_url_fun,
  property_filter = NULL,
  skip_image_metadata = FALSE,
  srs = NULL,
  srs_overwrite = FALSE,
  duration = c("center", "start")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{STAC feature collection}

\item{out_file}{optional name of the output SQLite database file, defaults to a temporary file}

\item{asset_names}{character vector with names of assets (e.g., bands) to be used, other assets will be ignored. By default (NULL), all asset names with "eo:bands" attributes will be used}

\item{asset_regex}{length 1 character defining a regular expression asset names must match to be considered}

\item{url_fun}{optional function to modify URLs of assets, e.g, to add /vsicurl/ to URLS (the default)}

\item{property_filter}{optional function to filter STAC items (images) by their properties; see Details}

\item{skip_image_metadata}{logical, if TRUE per-image metadata (STAC item properties) will not be added to the image collection}

\item{srs}{character spatial reference system of images used either for images without corresponding STAC property ony or for all images}

\item{srs_overwrite}{logical, if FALSE, use srs only for images with unknown srs (missing STAC metadata)}

\item{duration}{character, if images represent time intervals, use either the"start" or "center" of time intervals}
}
\description{
This function creates an image collection from a STAC API collection response. It does not
need to read any image data. Additionally, bands can be filtered and asset links can be transformed to make them
readable for GDAL.
}
\details{
The property_filter argument can be used to filter images by metadata such as cloud coverage. 
The functions receives all properties of a STAC item (image) as input list and is expected to produce a single logical value,
where an image will be ignored if the function returns FALSE.
}
\note{
Currently, bbox results are expected to be WGS84 coordinates, even if bbox-crs is given in the STAC response.
